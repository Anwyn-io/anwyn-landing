# Anwyn | The Privacy Sanctuary

**Anwyn** is a privacy-first "Walled Garden" built on the **Midnight Network**. We provide a secure environment for users to safeguard their digital identity while participating in the **World Mobile** ecosystem.

## 🌿 The Vision
In the current DePIN landscape, users often trade personal privacy for network rewards. Anwyn breaks this trade-off by utilizing Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to create a "Shadow Vault" for sensitive metadata.

## 🛡️ Key Features
- **Data Cloaking:** Protects user location and identity metadata.
- **Sovereign Yield:** Enables secure accumulation of USDCx rewards.
- **Universal Basic Services:** Provides a foundation for community-led connectivity.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Blockchain:** Midnight (Cardano Sidechain)
- **Infrastructure:** World Mobile Chain
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS (Hosted via Vercel)

## 📅 Roadmap
- **Phase 1:** Brand identity and community alignment.
- **Phase 2:** Midnight Build Club integration and ZK-circuit design.
- **Phase 3:** Pilot launch for World Mobile AirNode operators.
